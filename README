Last year a created a repository called ZombieDefence to practice Ruby on Rails. This repository is to help me learn Play Framework with scala. PostgreSQL with geocoding will be used to map the zombie outbreaks. Then I will have a chance to test if direct REST connections from a mobile device are faster than sockets.
 
 Since this project was created for learning there is no goal and the site will evolve over time.
 
The following REST API calls are currently working.
 
  /users        - No parameter will list all users
  /users        - Create user by sending correct Json
  /users/:id	- Get a user by ID number
  /usersRadius	- Get all users within 
 
 
These functions are not ready for use (Some locations are hard coded and will be finished later)
  /createMap    - Creates a map
  /location     - Get longitude and latitude from an address
  /bearing		- Returns longitude and latitude at distance and bearing from location
  /distance     - Distance between two longitudes and latitudes

# Temporary to try things out
  /test         - Whatever is here will keep changing


Get all users

  curl \
	--header "Content-type: application/json" \
	--request GET \
	--data '{}' \
	localhost:9000/users \
	| python -mjson.tool
	
Get user by ID

  curl \
	--header "Content-type: application/json" \
	--request GET \
	--data '{}' \
	localhost:9000/users/1 \
	| python -mjson.tool
	
Create user

  curl \
	--header "Content-type: application/json" \
	--request POST \
	--data '{"userName" : "Jimmy28991", "email" : "Jimmy28991.com", "password" : "secr2Es3Sts", "livingStatus" : "human", "latitude" : 37.123, "longitude": -127.456}' \
	localhost:9000/users \
	| python -mjson.tool

Get all users within x meters from latitude and longitude as well as users by Living Status(human, zombie, unknown, missing).  Unknown status is when a person is badly injured and could turn into a zombie or get better.

  curl \
	--header "Content-type: application/json" \
	--request POST \
	--data '{"livingStatus" : "human", "latitude" : 48.432044, "longitude": -71.060316, "radiusMeters": 2000}' \
	localhost:9000/usersRadius \
	| python -mjson.tool
